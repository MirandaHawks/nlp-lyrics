This is a brief blog post I made for my college English Writing class. The purpose was to write about something in your field in a genre that is common. As blog posts are hugely important in Computer Science, I decided to write a brief blog post talking about some research I did for my Natural Language Processing class. I believe it's hugely important to be able to communicate technical topics to both technical and non-technical people, so I tried to write it in a way that could be easily understood by those who know nothing about Natural Language Processing or Computer Science in general.
