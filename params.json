  "body": "#Lyrical Analysis Using Natural Language Processing\r\n\r\nAs a musician and a programmer, I am often trying to find ways to combine the two subjects. One field of interest for me is using programs in order to analyze music. There are a lot of fun projects you can do as a way to learn how to analyze audio files such as creating a music visualizer or creating your own Shazam-like application. But I found that I never saw much about analyzing lyrics in songs.\r\n\r\nLuckily, in my Natural Language Processing class, I’ve had a chance to look into what NLP techniques can be used to analyze lyrics, and how effective they are. It turns out, there’s a lot of research going on in this area as this isn’t an easy problem to solve. There are a few things to know about the research that has been done so far.\r\n\r\n## What is Lyrical Analysis?\r\n\r\nFirst, lyrical analysis doesn’t necessarily just mean sentiment analysis. There are a lot of other reasons to look at lyrics. As Mahedero, Martinez, and Cano show, you can find out what language the song is in with high accuracy. You can extract the song structure, meaning you can pull out the verses, chorus, bridge, etc with decently high accuracy (they achieved 76.66% accuracy). You can use techniques to determine how similar lyrics are, a useful tool for piracy detection in music or for recommendation systems.\r\n\r\nBut still, the topic most people are probably interested in is sentiment analysis, which isn’t easy. Mahedero, Martinez, and Cano were able to determine the theme of songs with 82% accuracy which is pretty high. But this was simply categorizing songs into 5 different themes -- Love, Violent, Protest (anti-war), Christian, and Drug. Why these specific themes were picked I’m not sure, but of course not all music can fit into these 5 categories.\r\n\r\n## The Big Issues\r\n\r\nThere are a few major issues with sentiment analysis in lyrics, outlined very well in a paper by Ashley Oudenne and Sarah Chasins:\r\n1. Songs can have negative lyrics, but end on a positive note, and vice versa\r\n2. Songs may not have specific words that are associated with being positive or negative, but they might still overall express a positive or negative sentiment.\r\n3. Songs can have negative emotions about positive things, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nBasically, lyrics are hard to deal with because they often are not as straightforward as some other types of writing such as reviews or internet comments. One of the bigger examples of sentiment analysis in NLP is movie reviews -- by looking for phrases like “I enjoyed” or “I hated”, etc. algorithms can determine whether or not a movie review is positive or negative. But for the reasons above, this is much harder with lyrics. Oudenne and Chasins did have some success with a pretty straightforward algorithm. They found that using word dictionaries yielded the best results, but still did not achieve accuracies as high as seen in movie reviews. Their technique involved creating dictionaries of positive and negative words, and then comparing words found in lyrics to these dictionaries, ignoring any words that are very common so as not to skew the results.\r\n\r\n## The Big Picture\r\n\r\nOne interesting paper was written by Xiao Hu and J. Stephen Downie. They decided to try and combine multiple different techniques in both lyrical analysis and audio analysis to determine sentiment in songs. They first ran experiments in lyrical analysis, picking the best possible algorithms and features to use. For audio analysis, they used a system of classification that has 63 different possible features, obtained using a Short Time Fourier Transform (check it out -- it’s not as scary as it sounds, I promise!)\r\n\r\nThey confirmed their beliefs that a hybrid system of musical and lyrical analysis would work better than analyzing the two separately. They found it was 8% more accurate than just lyrics and 9.6% more accurate than just audio, and also reduced the training data needed! Engineering aside, as a musician this is very exciting as it shows how lyrics and music can be combined to create an overall atmosphere and tone for a song. These findings are also interesting if you think about how it can be implemented into services like Spotify and Apple Music. If we can analyze not just the musical style but the lyrical themes a user likes the best, we can use this technique to improve recommendation systems and algorithmically generated playlists!\r\n\r\nOf course, there are many other papers on this issues, but I found that these three summed up the primary obstacles and advances of the field very well. I encourage you to read through the papers (although let’s face it, research papers aren’t exactly easy to read -- but at least skim through them). Maybe even try implementing some of the techniques seen -- it could be a fun but challenging exercise, and running it on your own music library could tell you something about your own musical taste!\r\n\r\n## Bonus: Unintentionally Funny Excerpts from Serious Research Papers\r\n\r\nOne thing I was particularly amused by while doing this research was seeing some lyrics in the context of a research paper. For example, this is an excerpt from the Oudenne and Chasins paper:\r\n\r\n_Cosine similarity algorithms also suffer from the second problem with lyrics analysis described in Section 2.2— the words in a song may have no obvious polarity, yet the song expresses a polar emotion._\r\n_In Will Smith’s “Miami”, the following stanza contains mainly neutral words:_\r\n\r\n_`Hottest club in the city and its right on the beach._\r\n_Temperature, get to ya’, it’s about to reach_\r\n_Five hundred degrees in the Caribbean seas_\r\n_With the hot mommies screaming “Ayy papi”`_\r\n\r\n_There is no word in this stanza that specifically expresses a polar emotion. “Hot” and “hottest” can be either positive or negative, and the rest of the words are relatively neutral. The only exception is the phrase “Ayy papi”, which is not present in any other document in the corpus, so tf-idf weighting is useless in identifying it as a positive emotion indicator. Additionally, most of these words are not at all related to either “happy” or “sad”, so the WordNet algorithm has difficulty classifying songs like this one._\r\n\r\nWho knew that the phrase \"Ayy papi\" could thwart such complicated sounding algorithms ;)",
